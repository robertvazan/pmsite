PMSite is a simplistic application framework built on top of [PushMode](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/) HTML streaming library. PushMode is a generic HTML streaming engine that is kept lightweight in order to remain relevant for a wide range of applications. It is thus in need of a companion framework that offers defaults for everything. Since PushMode is very new, there are no comprehensive frameworks built around it. PMSite is a simple (even lazy) web framework for PushMode that fills the gap for now.

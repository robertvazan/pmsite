# PMSite #

PMSite is a simplistic application framework built on top of [PushMode](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/) HTML streaming library. PushMode is a generic HTML streaming engine that is kept lightweight in order to remain relevant for a wide range of applications. It is thus in need of a companion framework that offers defaults for everything. Since PushMode is very new, there are no comprehensive frameworks built around it. PMSite is a simple (even lazy) web framework for PushMode that fills the gap for now. PMSite has basic built-in support for page templates (plain XML), widget API, live reload, web server integration (jetty), analytics (Google Analytics), cookies, storage of user preferences, sitemaps, schema.org, and of course an API to define site and page structure.

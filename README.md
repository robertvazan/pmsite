PMSite is a simplistic application framework built on top of [PushMode](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/) HTML streaming library.
PushMode is a generic HTML streaming engine that is kept lightweight in order to remain relevant for a wide range of applications.
PMSite is a simple (even lazy) web framework for PushMode that offers defaults for everything.
PMSite however places no constraints on site content or page layout.

# PMSite #

PMSite is a simplistic application framework built on top of [PushMode](https://pushmode.machinezoo.com/) HTML streaming library. PushMode is a generic HTML streaming engine that is kept lightweight in order to remain relevant for a wide range of applications. PMSite is a simple (even lazy) web framework for PushMode that offers defaults for everything.

## Status ##

PMSite is in early alpha stage. Most code is a temporary placeholder for future implementation. Class-level progress is tracked using [Stagean annotations](https://stagean.machinezoo.com/).

## Download ##

PMSite is available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.machinezoo.pmsite/pmsite). Further setup instructions are on the [website](https://pmsite.machinezoo.com/). PMSite is distributed under [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).
